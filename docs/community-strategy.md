## 9. Risk Mitigation

### 9.1 Low Ambassador Retention

**Risk:** Ambassadors churn due to low earnings or burnout

**Mitigation:**
- Monthly 1-on-1 check-ins (identify issues early)
- Tiered stipends (performance-based, not flat rate)
- Recognition program (spotlight top performers)
- Quarterly retreats (team bonding, training refresh)

### 9.2 Low Event Attendance

**Risk:** Clinics/webinars have <20 attendees

**Mitigation:**
- Partner with local associations (co-host, leverage their networks)
- Offer incentives (free data bundles, swag, lunch)
- Schedule on weekends/evenings (avoid business hours)
- Promote 3+ weeks in advance (multiple reminders)

### 9.3 Community Toxicity

**Risk:** Spam, misinformation, or harassment in WhatsApp/Discord

**Mitigation:**
- Clear community guidelines (posted in channel descriptions)
- Active moderation (remove bad actors within 1 hour)
- Report mechanism (DM moderators for escalations)
- Weekly audits (review flagged messages)
