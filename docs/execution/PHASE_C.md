# Phase C — UX, Inclusion & User Education (V5.0.2)

**Objective:** Ensure flows are usable by low-bandwidth, low-literacy users and remain offline-first.

## Gate (Must Pass)
- Core flows complete in < 30 seconds for target users
- Offline indicators and sync states are explicit (no silent failure)
- English + Nigerian Pidgin parity for core flows

## Current Status (2026-01-18)
- ✅ Mobile UX polish + theme tokens completed (per Phase F master report)
- ✅ Onboarding and multi-language support reported as complete

## Next Actions
1. Run a 10-user internal pilot with forced 2G/flight mode toggles
2. Collect top 10 confusion points; patch copy and error states
