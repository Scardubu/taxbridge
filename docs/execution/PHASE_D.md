# Phase D — Documentation & Compliance Alignment (V5.0.2)

**Objective:** Make README + deployment guides consistent, complete, and compliant.

## Gate (Must Pass)
- README and deployment docs match current build/deploy behavior
- NDPC: encryption + audit logging documented
- NRS rule: No direct integration (APP only) clearly stated

## Current Status (2026-01-18)
- ✅ Multiple deployment guides exist; staging flow documented
- 🔶 Ongoing: reconcile any drift between docs and scripts

## Next Actions
1. Ensure staging migration steps and health validation steps are identical across docs
2. Ensure all docs reflect mock-mode soft launch approach when credentials missing
